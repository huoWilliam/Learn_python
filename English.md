### ==Finding fastest driving routes is significant for the intelligent transportation system.== While predicting the online traffic conditions of road segments entails a variety of challenges, ==it contributes much to travel time prediction accuracy.== ==We propose O-Sense,== an innovative online-traffic-prediction, which utilizes large scale taxi GPS traces and environmental information. O-Sense firstly exploits a deep learning approach to process spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces. Meanwhile, we model the traffic flow state for a given road segment using a linear-chain CRF. O-Sense then fuses previously obtained outputs with a dynamic weighted classifier and generates a better traffic condition vector for each road segment at different prediction time. Finally, we perform online route computing to find the fastest path connecting consecutive road segments in the route based on the vectors. ==Experimental results show that O-Sense can estimate the travel time for driving routes more accurately.==
